# CarboBlaster
A sonification of CO pollution using ghetto blasters (and a wemos ESP8266).


-=- TODO -=-
Get the data from the CO sensor (eqcq)
need to check if there is a limit of 4 clients for the udp server...we can't seem to get to 11

-=- Done -=- 
keep track of the connected clients in an array (eqcq)
Transfer to binary (eqcq)
Send to the clients (4) ((eqcq)
test the lowest speed limit (alx)
Test send via multicast pour limiter la latence (alx) (best to send to individual IPs it's low latency
